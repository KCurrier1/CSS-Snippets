                <summary>Where I came from...</summary>
                <p>I was born and raised in the small farm town of Blythe, California.
                There was very little opportunity to do much of anything there so I
                worked hard to get a good GPA in highschool where I could further my
                education at Grand Canyon University. I was apart of numerous clubs as
                well as captaining our Marching Band's small Colorguard team. My
                mother is the Chief Nursing Officer of our local hospital, and my dad
                has bounced through many maintenance jobs and has ultimately retired
                due to his health. We have not always been this well off, and my mom
                has worked hard to be where she is. We don't have the best
                relationship but I do look up to her as someone who knows how to put
                in effort to get what they want. I aspire to do the same, despite not
                exactly following in her footsteps.</p>

                <p>
                    I was a Computer Programming Major for two years before switching to
                    the new Bachelors of Science in Software Development degree. It is
                    quite apparent that this is not a very "feminine" topic to study. This
                    was very intimidating in the beginning but is also a big source of
                    motivation for me. I aim to persevere and become a mentor for girls
                    who want to pursue a career in this field. Although, since I have had
                    time to develop a lot of my skills so far, I have taken a liking to
                    more of the design aspect of website building. However, I don't want
                    to be categorized as simply a designer, because it seems that is where
                    many women are funneled into and get stuck. I want to prove that I can
                    program from frontend to backend, without taking shortcuts on my
                    database layers or turning in ugly looking website designs. I believe
                    with a bit of determination and hard work, I can do it all well.
